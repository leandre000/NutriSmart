# App Icon Instructions

## Adding Your App Icon

1. **Prepare Your Icon:**
   - Size: 1024x1024 pixels
   - Format: PNG
   - Design: Simple, recognizable nutrition/health icon
   - Colors: Use app's primary green (#33B366) as base

2. **In Xcode:**
   - Navigate to Assets.xcassets → AppIcon
   - Drag your 1024x1024 PNG image into the placeholder
   - Xcode will automatically generate all required sizes

3. **Temporary Solution:**
   - If you don't have an icon yet, the app will use the default iOS app icon
   - You can add a proper icon later

## Icon Design Tips

- Keep it simple and recognizable
- Use the app's color scheme (green, yellow, orange)
- Ensure it looks good at small sizes
- Test on different backgrounds
